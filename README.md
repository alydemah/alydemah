### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a software engineer who is very passionate about how to make things efficient while maintaining simplicity and clarity.
Right now I enjoy building apps using C#, Typescript, Javascript, as well as helpful websites using HTML, and CSS.
I often use Angular to build web apps, and either NestJS or dotnet core webapi for backend.
Aside from that, I spent some of my spare time doing weightlifting and cooking.
