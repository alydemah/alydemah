##  About Me

I’m a **fullstack engineer with a strong backend & system design focus**, experienced in building and operating production systems end-to-end  from frontend UX to backend architecture, infrastructure, and CI/CD.

I care deeply about:

- **Performance, scalability, and observability**
- **Developer experience (DX)**
- **Automation & infrastructure as code**
- **Privacy-first and self-hosted solutions**

I enjoy working close to real problems: data, scale, reliability, and long-term system evolution.
